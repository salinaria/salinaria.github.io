I had the pleasure of presenting my research paper, **"ERUnderstand,"** which is currently under review. The talk focused on evaluating and improving how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and LLMs reason over structured Entity-Relationship diagrams.

It was a fantastic session with the UPenn Database Group, filled with insightful questions and great discussions on the future of multimodal AI in scientific contexts.
