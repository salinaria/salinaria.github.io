My Thesis
======

My final thesis was about a glasses shop using 3D augmented reality. This shop enables the customers to try the glasses on their face, and then buy it more satisfactory.

I thank all my family, friends and also my supervisor, Dr. Bagheri who helped me through this.

My thesis code is available [here](https://github.com/salinaria/gaboor-optic) and my paper in Farsi is available [here](https://github.com/salinaria/gaboor-optic/blob/main/payan_name.pdf).
