I am a recent graduate of Amirkabir University, having earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer engineering. My primary focus and
area of expertise is in the field of NLP, which I have studied extensively through various courses and projects. I possess hands-on
experience in information retrieval, text mining, sentiment analysis, and text classification. I am highly motivated to continue my studies and research in this field.
