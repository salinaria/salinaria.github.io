I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Temple University. I research on Named Entity Recognition in Dr. Dragut's lab.
My primary focus and area of expertise is in the field of NLP, which I have studied extensively through various courses and projects. I possess hands-on experience in information retrieval, text mining, sentiment analysis, and text classification. I am highly motivated to continue my studies and research in this field.
