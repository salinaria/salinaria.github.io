👋 Welcome!

**Hi, I'm Ali!** Welcome to my academic homepage.

I am a second-year Ph.D. student and **University Fellow** in Computer Science at **Temple University**, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Dragut.

My current research is centered on **Multimodal AI**, specifically exploring how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) reason over structured scientific diagrams. I actively design evaluation benchmarks, analyze failure modes, and develop methods to improve model robustness on Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.

Before joining Temple, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the **Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)** in 2024. My earlier research includes work published at ICWR 2023 on transformer-based Persian language recognition.

🚀 **Internship Search:** I am actively seeking a **Summer or Fall 2026 research internship** where I can apply my multimodal Machine Learning expertise to build and improve real-world systems.
